# Followers vs. Following on Instagram #

### This script allows you to check who doesn't follow you back on Instagram, without any logging in required! ###

1. Log into Instagram on your web browser.
2. Navigate to Settings > Privacy and security > Data Download, then click "Request Download".
3. Enter the email you'd like your data to be sent to, then make sure you select the **JSON** data format!
4. Once you receive your Instagram information, download it and navigate to the folder named "followers_and_following".
5. From that folder, drag "followers.json" and "following.json" into a folder with "not_following_back.py". The "followers.json" and "following.json" within this repository are just empty placeholders and can be removed/overwritten.
6. Run "not_following_back.py", and a text file containing the usernames of those who don't follow you back will be generated within the same folder :)
